I remember the good old days. Creating a new web app was simple. All you needed to do was to create an HTML file, add jQuery and your source code with a `<script>` tag and you were good to go.

Today it's different.

The apps you build today are more and more complex. Your project uses tens or hundreds of JS files and also lots of dependencies.

Inserting script tags is no longer a good enough solution - it just doesn't scale. It would give many HTTP roundtrips and make your apps slow. It's would also be difficult to maintain your app.

This is where webpack comes into play.
